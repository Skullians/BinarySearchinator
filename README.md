## About The Project

Binary Searchinator is a tool dedicated towards simplifying the task of binary searching your Minecraft Plugins and Mods, featuring a user-friendly UI.


Binary Searching is a complicated and often lengthy process when done by hand. Although it is one of the fastest methods of identifying problems on your server, this process can become **very extensive** in modded applications when you have 100+ mods on your server.

This is where Binary Searchinator comes in. It relieves the majority of the burden concerning Binary Searching, including:
* Identifying Dependencies + Management
* Disabling Mods / Plugins

## Built With

Binary Searchinator is built in Java, using **[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)** for it's UI.

## Getting Started

At this current point in time, this tool only supports Windows (*and possibly MacOS which is untested*).

To run this tool, you require **Java 17** or higher.
This project will run best with **Java 21**, however Java 17 is the minimum.
You can get the Java 17 JDK from **[Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=17&package=jdk)** for your Operation System.

## Usage

Download the latest jarfile from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/Skullians/BinarySearchinator/releases)**.

You can then either open the jarfile via:
`Right Click -> Open`, or, in **Command Prompt**, run:
`java -jar path/to/BinarySearchinator.jar`
Follow the instructions on the window that then appears.
